# Pokedex project in typescript.
- This project was made as part of the boot.dev TS+ Python Backend developer curriculum.

# What it specifically teached me:
- Realistic example of calling API's over HTTP in TS as client using the JS fetch() api. 
- What is REPL and how to use make a CLI application in TS.
- How to implement cache to reduce the amount of API calls.
